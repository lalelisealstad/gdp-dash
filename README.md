# get-gdp-dashboard 

Simple Flask Dash app to see GDP of a country and see a figure showing the growth of GDP. Uses World Bank API to get history of GDP. 

I created repo as a project to try out test files, github acitons workflow and IAM secirity settings to learn. 

Unit testing and integration testing of the functions used in the dashboard. 



### Run app locally: 
$ python3 -m venv .venv
$ source .venv/bin/activate 
$ poetry install 
$ python app.py

## TODO: 

- github actions ruff linter and testing
- github actions deploy to gcp 
- make dashboard only visible to some authenticated users
